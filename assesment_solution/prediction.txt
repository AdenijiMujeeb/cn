QUESTION 2 APPROACH.
The following steps are how I would approach the above question:
Assuming that the rank column is used to determine the drivers’ position and the circuit is the same as the track.
1.	I would join the 3 datasets which are Drivers, Race and Results using inner join on the raceId and driverId.
2.	I would remove all the null values in the resulting datasets generated in step 1 above.
3.	I would check the correlation between all the joined dataset columns by plotting correlation matrix heatmap. This would enable me to select the columns that has strong correlations among themselves.
4.	Since I want to predict the likely winner of a race on a particular track, I can treat the target variable as either a regression or a classification. 
5.	I would use some machine learning algorithms and would compare the results of their predictions such as linear regression, support vector machines, and random forest.
6.	Then, I would split the dataset into test and train sets using the year. I would be training with datasets from 2008 downwards and would be testing with only 2009 dataset alone.
7.	I would be using the rank column as the target variable i.e Y and other columns as X. 
8.	Then, I would fit the data into the model.
9.	I would plot a confusion matrix to show the actual and the predicted values of the driver and their circuit Id using the prediction probabilities. Or I would view the prediction probabilities of each driver for the particular track and the driver with the highest probability would be predicted as the winner.

QUESTIONS:
- I am not too familiar with car racing but from the race data, I am assuming that the circuit is the same as the track right?
- Is the rank column used to determine the drivers’ position (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc ) in a race?
